# Speed-Limit-Law

Simple statistics calculations such as t-test, boxplot, summary statistics using r

## Import data

      df <- read.csv(file = "hw1_speed_data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

**Q1**

Generate summary statistics for vehicular speeds data and compare the results.

      summary(df$speed_before)
      summary(df$speed_after)

**Findings:**

- The mean and median vehicular speed before the repeal of a speed limit law are 57.66 (mph) and 57.85 (mph), respectively. The mean and median vehicular speed after the repeal of a speed limit law are 60.49 (mph) and 59.45 (mph), respectively.

- Both mean and median vehicular speed after the repeal of the speed limit were greater than before the repeal.

- The minimum and maximum vehicular speed before the repeal of a speed limit law are 32.60 and 69.50, respectively.. The minimum and maximum vehicular speed after the repeal of a speed limit law are 45.60 and 72.50, respectively.

- The third quarter vehicular speed after (63.50 mph) the repeal of a speed limit law was slightly higher than before (60.00 mph) the repeal.

- There exists missing 192 speed data records for after the repeal of limit law.

**Q2**

Generate and interpret box-plots for vehicular speeds data (make them look nice).

      boxplot(df$speed_before, 
        ylab = "Speed (mph)", 
        col = "tomato",
        main = "Boxplot of Speed Before the Repeal of a Speed Limit Law")
 
      boxplot(df$speed_after, 
        ylab = "Speed (mph)",
        col = "purple",
        main = "Boxplot of Speed After the Repeal of a Speed Limit Law")
 
**Findings:**

- The Box-plot of Speed before the repeal of a speed limit law shows there exists numerous extreme values or outliers.

- The Box-plot of Speed after the repeal of a speed limit law shows there exists less outlier(s) or extreme value(s).

- Outliers have great impact on the mean value of the speed before the repeal but have little effect on the median.

- The upper whisker of Speed after the repeal of a speed limit law is longer compared to lower whisker, however it is equally same for speed before the repeal of limit law.

- The median line of Speed after the repeal of speed limit law is not centered, however it is centered for speed before the repeal of limit law. This shows the speed after the repeal data is skewed.

**Q3**

Generate and interpret histograms for vehicular speeds data (make them look nice).

      hist(df$speed_before,
      ylab = "Speed (mph)",
      xlab = "Speed Before",
      col = "tomato",
      main = "Histogram of Speed Before the Repeal of a Speed Limit Law")
 
      hist(df$speed_after,
      ylab = "Speed (mph)",
      xlab = "Speed After",
      col = "purple",
      main = "Histogram of Speed After the Repeal of a Speed Limit Law")
 
**Findings:**

- The histogram plot of Speed before the repeal of a speed limit law shows the distribution appears normal.

- The histogram plot of Speed after the repeal of a speed limit law shows the distribution is skewed.

**Q4**

      library(tidyverse)
      df |> 
      drop_na() |>
      filter(speed_before > 60) |> 
      summarise(MEAN_SPEED = mean(speed_after),
      MEDIAN_SPEED = median(speed_after))

MEAN_SPEED = 61.3731 ; MEDIAN_SPEED = 59.9
            
**Findings:**

- The mean and median values of the after-speed data for those particular vehicles whose speeds before the repeal were greater than 60 mph were 61.3731 mph and 59.9 mph, respectively.

**Q5**

Find out the frequency distribution of vehicular after-speed data and interpret results.

      library(gtsummary)
      df |>
      select(speed_after)|>
      mutate(speed_after_ = as.factor(speed_after)) |>
      tbl_summary() |>
